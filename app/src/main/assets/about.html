<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ol>
    <li><b>Recipe Storage and Organization</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Create and Save Recipes:</b> Users can input their own recipes with detailed ingredients, instructions and cooking times. Recipes are stored in a personal collection and can be easily filtered by categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert).
            </li>

            <li><b>Print and Share:</b> Recipes can be printed directly from the app and shared using text messaging. Measurements can be automatically adjusted based on the desired serving size.
            </li>

            <li><b>Import and Export:</b> Your entire library of recipes, and shopping lists, can be exported as a JSON file directly to your Google drive. Then imported from the same place. This allows you to backup all your recipes for safe keeping.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Recipe Generation and Suggestions</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Generate New Recipes:</b> Based on a brief description, or just ingredients you have on hand, the app can generate new recipes. This helps reduce food waste and encourages creative cooking.
            </li>

            <li><b>AI-Powered Improvements:</b> The app can anaylze an existing recipe and suggest variations based on user requests. It can suggest improvements such as alternate cooking techniques, flavor enhancements, or added ingredients.

    </li>
    <li><b>Shopping List Integration</b>
        <ul>
